## Mapillary QA Challenge 

This is my submission for Mapillary's QA Software Engineer Position.

My task was to create a basic API with persistent storage and website that could both add to and get content from that API and then proceed to right a number of different tests for the API and website. 

I used Flask to create the API and Dash to create the website as it let me stay programming in Python for the entire challenge. 

For my tests, I used the standard python unittest framework as my testing platform, and used requests to query the API and Selenium to test the website.
